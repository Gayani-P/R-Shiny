This project explores the utility of the R Shiny package and its related functions 
by creating an app that allows users to interact with a train ridership dataset 
published by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

In order to keep track of service performance, the MBTA makes public data they collects on
ridership, which is the number of people who ride a system of public transportation.
Ridership in the dataset utilized for this project is measured through an automated fare
collection system which counts CharlieCard and ticket taps of passengers paying to
board trains at each stop. This dataset, consisting of 2,728 data points, was compiled
and aggregated based on the average ridership of the red, orange, blue, and green line trains
during the Fall 2023 season at specific times of the week and specific times of the day
for each train stop.
